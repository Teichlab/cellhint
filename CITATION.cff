  abstract: Harmonizing cell types across the single-cell community and assembling them
    into a common framework is central to building a standardized Human Cell Atlas.
    Here, we present CellHint, a predictive clustering tree-based tool to resolve cell-type
    differences in annotation resolution and technical biases across datasets. CellHint
    accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and places cell types into
    a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and unique cell subtypes.
    Application to multiple immune datasets recapitulates expert-curated annotations.
    CellHint also reveals underexplored relationships between healthy and diseased lung cell
    states in eight diseases. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset
    integration guided by harmonized cell types and cell hierarchy, which uncovers underappreciated
    cell types in adult human hippocampus. Finally, we apply CellHint to 12 tissues from 38
    datasets, providing a deeply curated cross-tissue database with âˆ¼3.7 million cells and various
    machine learning models for automatic cell annotation across human tissues.
